Electric Vehicle Survey Analysis
**Project Description:**
This project analyzes survey data related to electric vehicle (EV) preferences. The analysis aims to uncover demographic trends and formulate targeted marketing strategies for promoting electric vehicles.
## Dependencies

To run the analysis script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Install the required Python packages using pip:

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:


2. Run the analysis script:


## Usage

The analysis script performs the following tasks:

- Loads the survey dataset (`Electric_Vehicle_Survey.csv`).
- Explores the dataset structure and displays the first few rows.
- Visualizes relationships between various factors such as age, income, area of living, and EV preferences.
- Summarizes insights derived from the analysis.
- Formulates recommendations for targeting specific demographics interested in EV adoption.

## File Structure

The project repository contains the following files:

- `analysis_script.py`: Python script for analyzing the electric vehicle survey data.
- `Electric_Vehicle_Survey.csv`: Dataset containing survey responses.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Results and Insights

The analysis provides the following key insights:

- Identification of preferred types of electric vehicles across different demographics.
- Analysis of income distribution trends based on the area of living.
- Examination of age distribution patterns and their correlation with EV preferences.

**Explanation of the Code**
The provided code is a Python script that analyzes an electric vehicle survey dataset using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

Importing Libraries:

pandas for data manipulation.
matplotlib.pyplot for plotting.
seaborn for statistical data visualization.
Loading the Dataset:

Reads a CSV file named 'Electric_Vehicle_Survey.csv' into a pandas DataFrame df.
Functions Defined:

explore_dataset(df): Prints column names and displays the first few rows of the dataset.
visualize_relationships(df, columns_of_interest): Generates several types of visualizations (pairplot, boxplot, histogram, and barplot) to explore relationships between different columns of interest in the dataset.
summarize_and_recommend(df): Computes summary statistics and formulates recommendations based on the analysis of the dataset.
Main Execution Flow:

Checks if the script is being run directly (if __name__ == "__main__").
Calls explore_dataset to inspect the dataset structure.
Defines columns_of_interest for visualization and analysis.
Calls visualize_relationships to create visualizations.
Calls summarize_and_recommend to provide insights and recommendations based on the dataset analysis.
